# 🚀 Machine Learning Crash Course – Summary
Hi, I'm Khawar Khan 👋

I recently completed an intensive Crash Course in Machine Learning, where I developed a strong foundation in core ML concepts and hands-on techniques. This journey covered:

🧠 Key Topics Learned
Supervised & Unsupervised Learning

Neural Networks & Deep Learning

Natural Language Processing (NLP) basics

Computer Vision (OpenCV) fundamentals

Model training, evaluation & optimization

Data preprocessing, feature engineering

🛠️ Tools & Skills Gained
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

OpenCV, NLTK, TensorFlow/Keras (basics)

Exploratory Data Analysis

Building & evaluating ML models

Working with real-world datasets

This crash course helped solidify my understanding of machine learning and deep learning fundamentals, and I’m excited to apply these skills in real projects.
